## About
Wildfire is a wildfire tracker that allows users to obtain information about the most current global wildfires. This allows users to be more aware of the recent wildfires.

## Context
This was a personal project built with React.JS and deployed via AWS amplify. The application takes data from a NASA API to provide information on the location of wildfires and then visualizes the geographical map using the Google Maps javascript API.
